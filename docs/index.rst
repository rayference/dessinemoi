*S'il vous pla√Æt, dessine-moi un mouton.*

Motivation
----------

*Dessine-moi* is a simple Python implementation of the factory pattern. It was
born from the need to create dynamically object trees from nested dictionaries
(*e.g.* a JSON document).

Features
--------

- Create a ``Factory`` object and register types to it.
- Use dictionaries to create objects from the factory.
- Create ``attrs``-compatible converters to automatically convert dictionaries
  to instances of registered types.
- Customise factories to your needs.

Getting started
---------------

*Dessine-moi* requires Python 3.8+ and depends on ``attrs``. It is tested with
Pytest.

Install from PyPI in your virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install dessinemoi

Using Conda:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c eradiate dessinemoi
