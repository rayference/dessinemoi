Usage
=====

Create a factory object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start using *Dessine-moi*'s factories, the first thing to do is to instantiate
the :class:`.Factory` class:


.. doctest::

   >>> import dessinemoi
   >>> factory = dessinemoi.Factory()

Our factory holds a *registry*, which maps *identifiers* (IDs), consisting of
strings, to Python types. Our factory has currently an empty registry:

.. doctest::

    >>> factory
    Factory(registry={})

Register types to the factory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's define a new Python type. For convenience, we will work with the ``attrs``
library, but *Dessine-moi* does not require you to use it. Let's define a simple
class:

.. doctest::

   >>> import attrs
   >>> @attrs.define
   ... class Sheep:
   ...     wool = attrs.field(default="some")

We can now register this class to the factory using the
:meth:`~.Factory.register` method:

.. doctest::

   >>> factory.register(Sheep, type_id="sheep")
   <class '__main__.Sheep'>
   >>> factory
   Factory(registry={'sheep': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Sheep'>, dict_constructor=None)})

Classes can also be registered upon declaration using :meth:`~.Factory.register`
as a decorator. In that case, the ``cls`` positional argument is omitted. If the
``type_id`` keyword argument is omitted, *Dessine-moi* looks for a ``_TYPE_ID``
class attribute to set the class's ID in the registry:

.. doctest::

   >>> @factory.register
   ... @attrs.define
   ... class Lamb(Sheep):
   ...     _TYPE_ID = "lamb"
   >>> factory
   Factory(registry={'sheep': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Sheep'>, dict_constructor=None), 'lamb': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Lamb'>, dict_constructor=None)})

.. note:: As can be seen from the previous code snippet, the call operator ``()``
   can be omitted if all arguments are omitted.

.. note:: When used as a decorator, :meth:`~.Factory.register` is best used
   last (*i.e.* at the top of the sequence).

By default, ID overwrite is not allowed. The ``overwrite_id`` parameter can be
set to ``True`` to force the registration of a type with an existing ID.

The :meth:`~.Factory.register` method features an optional ``dict_constructor``
argument which, when set, associates a class method constructor to be called
upon attempting dictionary conversion. See `Convert objects`_ for more detail.

Alias registered types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having multiple IDs pointing to the same registered type may be useful as well.
Types can be aliased after registration using the :meth:`~.Factory.alias`
method:

.. doctest::

   >>> factory.alias("sheep", "mouton")
   >>> factory
   Factory(registry={'sheep': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Sheep'>, dict_constructor=None), 'lamb': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Lamb'>, dict_constructor=None), 'mouton': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Sheep'>, dict_constructor=None)})

Aliases may also be created using :meth:`~.Factory.register`'s ``aliases``
keyword argument.

.. doctest::

   >>> del factory.registry["sheep"]
   >>> del factory.registry["mouton"]
   >>> factory.register(Sheep, type_id="sheep", aliases=["mouton"])
   <class '__main__.Sheep'>
   >>> factory
   Factory(registry={'lamb': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Lamb'>, dict_constructor=None), 'sheep': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Sheep'>, dict_constructor=None), 'mouton': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class '__main__.Sheep'>, dict_constructor=None)})

Instantiate registered types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a type is registered, it can be instantiated using the :meth:`~.Factory.new`
method. If constructed class's constructor expects arguments, the ``args`` and
``kwargs`` arguments will forward them appropriately:

.. doctest::

   >>> merino = factory.create("sheep", kwargs={"wool": "lots"})
   >>> merino
   Sheep(wool='lots')

If you want to restrict the set of allowed types, the ``allowed_cls`` argument is
here:

.. doctest::

   >>> factory.create("sheep", allowed_cls=Lamb)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   TypeError: 'sheep' does not reference allowed type <class '__main__.Lamb'> or any of its subtypes

.. note:: Under the hood, ``allowed_cls`` is passed to a call to
   :func:`isinstance`: it can therefore be a single type or a tuple of allowed
   types.

Any subtype of an allowed type is allowed:

.. doctest::

    >>> factory.create("lamb", allowed_cls=Sheep)
    Lamb(wool='some')

.. note::

   A very common and Pythonic design pattern consists in defining special
   constructors using class methods. If you use this approach, *Dessine-moi*
   lets you select a constructor using the ``construct`` argument. For
   demonstrative purposes, let us attach a class method constructor to our
   ``Sheep`` class:

   .. doctest::

      >>> @classmethod
      ... def unsheavable(cls):
      ...     return cls(wool="none")
      >>> Sheep.unsheavable = unsheavable

   We can now route object creation to this function using the ``construct``
   keyword argument. Since the ``unsheavable()`` class method takes no argument,
   we do not pass the ``args`` and ``kwargs`` arguments:

   .. doctest::

      >>> factory.create("sheep", construct="unsheavable")
      Sheep(wool='none')


Convert objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Dessine-moi*'s factories implement converters which can be used as part of the
``attrs`` conversion step. In its most straightforward form, the
:meth:`~.Factory.convert` method operates on a ``value`` argument.

* If ``value`` is not a dictionary, :meth:`~.Factory.convert` returns it
  unchanged.
* If ``value`` is a dictionary, :meth:`~.Factory.convert` queries its ``type``
  entry for a type ID and uses it to call :meth:`~.Factory.new`.

  .. doctest::

     >>> factory.convert({"type": "sheep", "wool": "lots"})
     Sheep(wool='lots')

.. admonition:: Notes
   :class: note

   * :meth:`~.Factory.convert` takes a ``allowed_cls`` argument and uses it
     exactly as :meth:`~.Factory.new` does.
   * Dictionary conversion won't work with classes expected non kw-only fields.
   * If a ``dict_constructor`` is associated to the registered type, it will be
     used to create the object instead of the default constructor.

     .. doctest::

        >>> factory.registry.clear()
        >>> factory.register(Sheep, type_id="sheep", dict_constructor="unsheavable")
        <class '__main__.Sheep'>
        >>> factory.convert({"type": "sheep"})
        Sheep(wool='none')

Extend factories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arguably, :meth:`~.Factory.convert` is rather limited. For instance, it works
only for classes whose constructors only take keyword arguments and reserves the
``type`` entry for factory ID specification. One could wish to change some of
that.

Fortunately, implementing custom conversion methods is simple: subclass
:class:`.Factory` and reimplement its :meth:`~.Factory.convert` method!

Lazy registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, registering a type to a factory without importing it may be
desirable. This is useful, for instance, when it is not sure that the registered
type will be used and therefore the import overhead may simply be unnecessary.

*Dessine-moi* supports lazy registration, which defers type import to
instantiation by the factory. This comes at the cost of some of the safety
checks, because no detailed information about the registered type will be
available.

Lazy registration can be performed by passing the fully qualified name of the
target type as a string:

.. doctest::

   >>> factory.registry.clear()
   >>> factory.register("datetime.datetime", type_id="datetime")
   LazyType(mod='datetime', attr='datetime')

At this stage, the :class:`datetime.datetime` class is not imported, it is
simply referenced by a :class:`.LazyType` instance.

.. doctest::

   >>> factory.registry
   {'datetime': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=LazyType(mod='datetime', attr='datetime'), dict_constructor=None)}

If we call :meth:`Factory.create`, the target type is imported and returned:

.. doctest::

   >>> factory.create("datetime", args=(2222, 2, 22))
   datetime.datetime(2222, 2, 22, 0, 0)

Since the type is imported, its registry entry is also updated:

.. doctest::

   >>> factory.registry
   {'datetime': FactoryRegistryEntry(cls=<class 'datetime.datetime'>, dict_constructor=None)}
